# Results

This directory contains experiment outputs and logs generated during model training and evaluation.  
Results are saved automatically by **PyTorch Lightning** and organized into subfolders by dataset and model configuration.  

## Structure

### /natural_logs/lightning_logs/
- Contains experiment logs generated by PyTorch Lightning.  
- Each run has its own numbered subfolder (e.g., `version_0/`, `version_1/`, …).  
- Inside each version folder:
  - **checkpoints/** – Saved model weights (`.ckpt` files). Typically includes the last checkpoint and the best-performing checkpoint (based on validation accuracy or loss).  
  - **events.out.tfevents…** – TensorBoard log files. These can be visualized with:
    ```bash
    tensorboard --logdir=results/lightning_logs
    ```
    Metrics such as training loss, validation loss, accuracy, and learning rate schedules are stored here.  

### /camelyon_16_logs/lightning_logs/
- Contains experiment results for **Whole Slide Image (WSI)** classification on the Camelyon16 dataset.  
- Subfolders follow the same Lightning log structure as above, with checkpoints and TensorBoard event files.

## Usage

To review results:
1. Launch TensorBoard to visualize metrics across datasets and model variants:
   ```bash
   tensorboard --logdir=results/lightning_logs
